This is meant to test the libssh2 code's protocol compliance against other
implementations. If you want to add a test, you will need to do the following:

* create a new source file, and add it to the Makefile

* call your main function (runtest_yourtest) from main() in main.c

* at the top of your source file, put:

	#include <libssh2.h>
	#include "libssh2-test.h"

	extern struct authdefs auth;


* call init_test("description of your test", number_of_steps)

* before every step in your test, call increase_progress()

* after every step, if it was successful, call step_successful()
