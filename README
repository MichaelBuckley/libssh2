libssh2 - SSH2 library
======================

Version 0.6
-----------

  Fix segfault when libssh2_session_methods() is called prior to session_startup().

  Fixed client to server channel windowing.  Pervent send queue overruns.

  Swapped banner send/receive order (send first, then wait for response).

Version 0.5
-----------

  *** BC Break ***
  Reimplemented libssh2_session_methods() to match libssh2_session_method_pref() style

  Fixed libssh2_attr2bin() (effects any setstat style call).

  Fixed authenticating with encrypted private key.

  Fixed authenticating via ssh-dss public key.

  Fixed KEX_INIT cookie and packet padding to use actual random data

  Added DESTDIR support to makefiles (Adam Go³êbiowski -- I hope that character set translates right)

  Added libssh2_channel_forward_listen_ex(), libssh2_channel_forward_cancel(), and libssh2_channel_forward_accept().

  Added ./configure option '--disable-gex-new' to allow using the older group-exchange format

  Added MAC methods hmac-md5 and hmac-md5-96.

Version 0.4
-----------

  Fixed crash when trying to free sftp_dirhandle data from a filehandle struct.

  Fixed leak in sftp_open_ex(), handle->handle not freed in handle_close().

  Fixed leak in sftp_symlink_ex(), result for READLINK and REALPATH not freed unless there was an error.

  Added libssh2_banner_set(), specify an arbitrary banner to send on introduction.

Version 0.3
-----------

  Fixed libssh2_channel_read_ex().  Packet loop initialized BEFORE transport polled for new packets (should have been after).

  Fixed blocking issues in scp_send()/scp_recv().

  Fixed degree of indirection in macerror callback.

  Changed packet read mechanism to use a fixed buffer and avoid unnecessary alloc/free calls. (especially while non-block looping)

  Added channel close callback.

  Added SFTP support (Using its own header file: libssh2_sftp.h)

Version 0.2
-----------

  Changed extended data ignorance mechanism:
    libssh2_channel_ignore_extended_data() changed to libssh2_channel_handle_extended_data()
    Macro introduced for backward compatability during beta phase.
    *** THE LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_IGNORE_EXTENDED_DATA() MACRO WILL BE REMOVED PRIOR TO 1.0 RELEASE ***
    libssh2_channel_handle_extended_data() may be passed one of three "ignore_mode" constants
      LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA_NONE       Default behavior, queue ED packets and return them with read_ex
      LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA_IGNORE     Equivalent to libssh2_channel_ignore_extended_data()
                                               IGNORE will implicitly flush the extended data stream(s)
      LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA_MERGE      Calls to channel_read() will check both the standard data stream
                                               and the extended data stream(s) for the first available packet

  Changed libssh2_session_disconnect_ex() to return an error code when alloc fails

  Added libssh2_channel_flush_ex() and basic macros: ..._flush() ..._flush_stderr()
    flush_ex accepts either the streamid (0 for standard data, 1 for stderr) or one of the two following constants:
      LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_FLUSH_ALL                Flush all streams
      LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_FLUSH_EXTENDED_DATA      Flush all streams EXCEPT the standard data stream

  Added libssh2_session_callback_set() for setting ignore/debug/disconnect/macerror callbacks

  Added libssh2_session_method_pref() to selectively set methods and method preferences.

  Added libssh2_session_methods() to determine what methods were negotiated.

  Added libssh2_session_abstract() for retreiving &session->abstract

  Added libssh2_session_last_error() for retreiving error codes/messages
