.SH NAME
libssh2_channel_write_ex - write data to a channel stream blocking
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libssh2.h>

size_t libssh2_channel_write_ex(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *channel, int stream_id,
                                char *buf, size_t buflen);

size_t libssh2_channel_write(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *channel, char *buf,
                             size_t buflen);

size_t libssh2_channel_write_stderr(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *channel, char *buf,
                                    size_t buflen);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Write data to a channel stream. All channel streams have one standard I/O
substream (stream_id == 0), and may have up to 2^32 extended data streams as
identified by the selected \fIstream_id\fP. The SSH2 protocol currently
defines a stream ID of 1 to be the stderr substream.

\fIchannel\fP - active channel stream to write to. 

\fIstream_id\fP - substream ID number (e.g. 0 or SSH_EXTENDED_DATA_STDERR) 

\fIbuf\fP - pointer to buffer to write

\fIbuflen\fP - size of the data to write

\fIlibssh2_channel_write(3)\fP and \fIlibssh2_channel_write_stderr(3)\fP are
macros.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Actual number of bytes written or negative on failure.
LIBSSH2CHANNEL_EAGAIN when it would otherwise block. While
LIBSSH2CHANNEL_EAGAIN is a negative number, it isn't really a failure per se.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
