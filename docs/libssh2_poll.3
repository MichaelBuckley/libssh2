.SH NAME
libssh2_poll - poll for activity on a socket, channel or listener
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libssh2.h>

int libssh2_poll(LIBSSH2_POLLFD *fds, unsigned int nfds, long timeout);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Poll for activity on a socket, channel, listener, or any combination of these
three types. The calling semantics for this function generally match
\fIpoll(2)\fP however the structure of fds is somewhat more complex in order
to accomodate the disparate datatypes, POLLFD constants have been namespaced
to avoid platform discrepencies, and revents has additional values defined.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Number of fds with interresting events.
